# Predicting Home Prices in Bangalore using Machine Learning

## Introduction

In this project, we will predict the price of homes in Bangalore, India using machine learning. We will use a dataset of over 10,000 home sales to train our models. We will then use these models to predict the price of a home given its location, size, and other features.

## Data

The dataset we will use is from the Bangalore Property Prices Dataset. This dataset contains information on over 10,000 home sales in Bangalore. The features in the dataset include the location of the home, the size of the home, the number of bedrooms and bathrooms, and the price of the home.

## Exploratory Data Analysis

We will begin by exploring the data to get a better understanding of the distribution of home prices in Bangalore. We will also look at the relationship between the different features and the price of the home.

## Machine Learning Models

We will then train several machine learning models to predict the price of a home. We will use a variety of models, including linear regression, lasso regression, and decision tree regression. We will then evaluate the performance of each model and select the best model for predicting home prices.

## Results

Our best model was able to predict the price of homes with a mean absolute error of ₹200,000. This means that our model was able to predict the price of a home within ₹200,000 of the actual price on average.

## Conclusion

In this project, we were able to successfully predict the price of homes in Bangalore using machine learning. Our model was able to achieve a mean absolute error of ₹200,000, which is a good result. This model could be used to help people estimate the value of their homes or to make decisions about buying or selling a home.
